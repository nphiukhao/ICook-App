The ICook application saves your go-to recipes with additional functions such as filtering by total cooking time and ingredients matching. The ingredients matching function allows users to input the ingredients the have and the app returns a recipe with the highest match of ingredients. The feature was built specifically with grocery waste control in mind while the cooking time filter feature was built for on-the-go usersâ€™ convenience.

The client side is built using a mobile-first design. To use any of the features, you'll be prompted to a login page. Then, login using 'Iam' as the username and 'Legit' as the password.
